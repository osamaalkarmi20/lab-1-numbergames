# lab-1

in this lab we worked on a mini game that takes a number from the user and this number diciedthe arry size that he will input each of its elements as integers if he didnt input intigers the exeption will 
appear which will tell the user the number is not the right format then the game will ask the user to input an intger in the range of (1 - the input number)  then it will ask him
to input a number to divde the product(the total sumation of the numbers multiplied by the number of the total array numbers).
and at the end it will show the result of ever element for example(sum , product and the divsion etc.).
